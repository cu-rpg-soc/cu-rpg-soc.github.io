While we don’t require membership for Cambridge students to attend our events, membership with CURTS gives you access to the following rights and privileges above non-members::

- Access to the CURTS [Library](@/games-resources/library.md);
- Right to attend and vote at the CURTS AGM.

Membership costs £3 per year for annual membership or a single payment of £8 for a lifetime membership (including life after Cambridge, as unlikely as such a prospect may seem). All membership fees go towards the society’s upkeep (eg: room booking and website hosting fees) and the purchase of new books for the CURTS library, so membership fees are critical to the society’s survival and expand the range of options available to members.
