" ... and that's how much membership money we've collected this year,"said the Treasurer. He looked up to [ind himself surrounded.
"OK," said the President, his vowel sounds getting shoner by the minute, "I move that I be provided with a Society-paid
drinks account."
"Fire!" shouted the Treasurer, fooling no-one. "Er... well actually that sounds quite reasonable..."
"And the Society should buy me a new amp," said the Vice-President, "because the one I've got is just TOO f---ING QUIET... oops••."
"Yes, yes," said the Treasurer, "I'm sure we can run to that."
"I need a new pair of boots," said a voice from a darkened corner.
"Sounds like money well spent," said the Treasurer nervously, as the rest of the Committee looked at each other and made the sign o[ the Evil Eye.
"Now there's a happy thing," said the Assistant Secretary, who was always saying things like that for no apparent reason.
"I just want a holiday," said the External Officer. This immediatdy engaged the enthusiasm of the rest o[ the Committee, and soon suggestions were nying thick. and fast - "Switzerland ... Barbados... the Plateau of Leng..."
"So that's settled," said the President.
The Secretary muttered something irrdevant about leather.
"Ycs, right, so I'll write the cheques now then, shall I?" said the Treasurer. "Now will you pfCaSt: let go of my balls?"

Those of you who have left University and receive your Newsletters through the post. please note that this costs us quite a lot in terms of stamps and envelopes.

whether we should continue to send you stuff. Current members who are leaving at the end of this year, please bear this in mind.

The weekly meeting scheduled for Tuesday 29th October has been moved to Wednesday 30th, but will still be held at 7:00pm in Emmanuel's Upper Hall. After that, it's back to Tuesdays again.

Sometime this term we want to devote one of the Tuesday meetings to a number of one-off scenarios, so that people can try out new or unfamiliar game systems/GMs/players. But to do this, we need GMs to run things. If anyone is interested in running something just for one evening, please get in touch with one of the Committee, letting him/her know the system you want to run, and the number of players you can cope with. We will then post the details (date etc.) in the next Newsletter.
