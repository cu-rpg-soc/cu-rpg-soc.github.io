_- Act II, Scene I -_

GM: Our interval away is llit - bestill

That noise thy choc-ice wrappers now do make.

'11s time again our party bold to join,

As they do potter round this fateful keep.

1st Player: I prithee now, what hour doth mark the time?

GM:	At grim Hecate's call, the hordes of night

Hath worked a darksome spell upon the land.

2nd Player: What sayest thou?

GM:		About midnight, all right?

On gargoyled threshold do you stand, but lo!

The door hath opened wide with ancient creak.

Butler:	May I help you, sir?

3rd Player:	Yes, where's the treasure?

GM:	'Through cobwebbed hall and stony gloom your guide

Doth lead you down unto a noisome crypt.

(Enter a Nameless Thing)

Thing: Ph'nglui mglw'nafb ere withal

Cthulhu in R1yeh doth fthagn.

GM: Unholy froth beslimes this squamous sight!

SAN rolls now each character must make.

4th Player:	Oops.

GM:	Of loathly fear thy breeches take their fill,

Ere this blaspheming spawn doth eat thy brain.

_(The Thing starves to death)_

4th Player: Phew, that was close.

GM:	A curse! I clear forgot

Thy wretched IQ is but meagre 8.

_(The party go through the Thing's orifices for loose change)_

We will continue to meet in the Upper Hall at Emmanuel on every Tuesday this tenn, except for the last three (23rd February; 2nd March; 9th March). Alternative arrangements will be made for these evenings (see next Newsletter). If we have any problems with the other meetings, a notice will be posted within the front gate at Emmanuel.

## Otte-Off5

Just to remind you that at the Weekly Meeting on Tuesday 26th .January, we are running some one-off sessions instead of the regular campaigns. If you missed the signing up for the variollc; scenarios at the meeting on the 19th, there may still be spaces available, so come along anyway. We'll probably have another session of one-offs later this year, should this one prove a success.
