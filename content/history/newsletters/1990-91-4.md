Once more into the breach.....(?)
Once more into the breaching charges.
You'vehad well over a fortnight to recover from the new years party (I have & I just can't wait until they
publish the photos). Another term and another chance to see how many nights each week you can save your
planet account

## Weekly meetings

Due to a random fluke of organisation, the weekly
meetings will continue this term exactly as last term.
19:00,Tuesdays in the Upper Hall, Emma.
## One-Offs
So far we have had an encouragingresponse to the
'one-offs'sessions to be held at the 3rd weekly meeting
(5th February).Anyonewanting to run a scenario
should let us know at or before the 2nd weekly meeting
this term. Prospective players should come to the start
of this meeting to sign up for a game so that the GMs
have a week to prepare.
## Pub Meeting
The Eater of Souls Appreciation Society will
convene on the evening of Thursday 24th January in
Catz Bar at 19:30.
## Annual Dinner
Question: Do you like to eat?
Question: Do you like to drink?
Question: Do you like dressing up in silly
costumes?
If the answer to any of the above questions is yes
then you don't want to miss this term's most
prestigious social event:-

By the way there's this wonderful pub in the middle of Oxford with several real ales and scrumpy on draught) will now be held at the one-offs session, so volunteers should should let us know at or before the 2 nd session and sign up for one of the scenarios that have a selecting committee member involved.
