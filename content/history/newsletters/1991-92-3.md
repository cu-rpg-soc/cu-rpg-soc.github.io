TRANSLATOR'S NOlI - An Introduction lo Illegible Gothic Typefaces .
Apparently some people had difficulty deciphering our last Newsletter, so in the interests of clarity, all headings have been sub-titled, and the following guide to the perplexed has been included. The essence o[ your average Gothic Typd.acc is that most of the letters look like other letters. However, with a little practice., one becomes used to this and can learn to read Gothic text fluently. To assist you in this, \Ye have included a number o[ common GMs' utterances, written in Gothic, accompanied by their translations into a more legible typeface.

l. "Xolt four pointf of bamagt" -"Gotyou,you bastard."
2.	"3'(( malt  ttt  roll for  ou" -"You'reabouttodiscovertheplot,andican'tstopyouexceptbycheating."
3.	" ou mrnn ou't>t run out of Batt 5J)ointf?" -secni
4.	"S'uft bon't roll 96 - 00" -"Ibavecursedyourdice."
s. " OU'(( nttb a critical fucctff' - "I wish I'd cursed your dice."
6.	" an 3 ftt our barncttr @ibttt, pleaft?" -"Doesn'tyourCharacterhave .anyweakpointsr
7.	" our  opponrnt  if ftill ftanbing" -"IammentallyrdiguringhisHitPoiots."
· 8 "3 tbinf tut'U lrnt>t it tt«t for ttif tutti" - "Maybe I didn't kill you all, but at least I've got you seriously worried."

Matt Nesbit:Kings-Box 665	Runequest, i any I am running a nearly systemless political campaign.
The fantasy setting is one of an arctic tundra, populated by antagonistic and proud tribes of nomadic hunter-gatherers.
The characters are tribesmen and women, who ave been shocked out of the political ignorance by a chance encounter. From this point on, their options are open: to right injustices, or to use their new-found subjectiv ty to further their own desire for power, magic, peace of mind or just to be anarchic. The aim of the ga,me is to be as selfish, manipulative and machiavellian as possible, or to have feelings of genuine outrage and a desire to do good.
The game penalizes heavily all unplanned violence. and any open crnnhat  is likely to reduce the players to bird food, Though assassination, back stabbing, poisoning, thievery, etc. are strongly suggested, the opposition are intelligent. [1 player sought)	Mondoy

Quentin Carroll: 314805	Twilight 2000
Over 50 years of European peace ended on 27 July 1996 with the outbreak of WWIII. A year later, the nukes started flying. By 2000 AD, civilization has vanished into nuclear fire, and the resulting famines, plagues and radiation have accounted for 50% of the wor1d's population. Yet the war drags on. Warlords, militias and marauders rule a devastated countryside; civilian government rarely exists outside people's memories of a happier time. This is a game of survival in a post-Holocaust world where equipment is	·
scarce and alcohol powers the few remaining vehicles. The hazards are
many and the reward may simply be a safe place t  sleep. [Players sought] -
TBA	.

Sorry that there ore so few campaigns left with room for players. but the above should give you on idea of the scope of what's going on. If you ore inspired to run your own campaign . I'll be rumlng another of these next term (take note. those of you current GMs Who never sent in your porogrophsO.. Some of these hove been edited for spoce/clarfty/spelling mistakes.
