_- Act I, Scene III -_

GM:		My NPC unto bis wormy grave hath gone, In dcatb my plot undone must seem lo lie. But 'tis not so! Prick back thy ears withal: Whal sprites do gibber in tbe airy void?
(Enter the Party from a great height)
1st Player: A noisome curse upon that evil day, When rules on falling ere were wrote!
GM:	Gotcha!
Thus do I spring my naked l'lot-Device,

Witb pennants black and sinister and hold.
1st Player:  J\ doughty oak I climb: what sign of life Doth skulk without within yon lurking keep?
GM:	In silence strange tbe darksome tower doth lie.
What doest thou?
3rd Player:		Methinks 'tis little sport That may be had in such a place. Thus so, We now do seek sucb climes as we may kill Some ores.

To bring these knaves unto this fateful place. Toe gorcy corpse did wear, and they did rob A Colostomy Bag of Mystic Flight.
4th Player:  I own that r did err, betides. That flask
No Potion ofHumungous Strength did hold.
GM:		Aclillles in his tent griped not like tbee, But now unto my words thyselves bethrall. 'Pon yonder hill a casrle marks its crag,

GM:

Players:

GM:

Er ... I spoke not of this before, But costly treasures now do twinkle bright Within this rich and wealthsome citadel.
Then wherefore do we tarry here?
(Exeunt)
Strike one!

## The library

We are issuing a general recall of all material; that have been taken out of the Library, primari]y for cataloguing purposes. You can renew things immediately, but we want to see them first, and we want to see them by the end of term at the latest. In particular, we want to get back the following, since we don't know where the hell they've got to:-

Cursc of the Cthonians

Cthulhu by (iaslight

The Labyrintbe Supplement

If you've got them, bring them back	OW.

The 24 hr role-playing marathon in aid of Rag will take place around the middle of next term, but if you would like to GM something, please start thinking about it now. What system will you be using? How many players do you want? Let us know first thing next January, so that the details can go in the next Newsletter.

## Dcsi5tt a T-SJdrt

We need a new Society T-shirt, so whoever comes up with the best design by Tuesday 26th
· January will get tw.o free t ckds to the Punt Party in May Week (generous, huh?). Designs should be in black and white on A3 sized paper (hear in:mind that the image on the eventual T­ shirt will be reversed to white on black), and should feature the Society name or an abbreviation thereof (CURS or CURPS) fairly prominently. A'i for the rest of it, something vaguely relevant to role-playing would help.

## l'l-tomix Rlcspacc

Sorry that the Society's Phoenix Filcspace isn't on line yet, but it should be by the end of tenn. The old "CUDADS" Filespace is still available in the meantime, and should contain the Campaign Directory and the Library list.
