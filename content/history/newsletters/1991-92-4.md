NEWSLETTER	the	Fourth	1991/1992

And so, a new term begins, and for all of us it's back to late nights slaving over i solu le problems with looming deadlines, puzzling over incomprehensible handouts, battling with malign and anonymous authorities, wrestling with personal diffic_ulties that no-one else can possibly understand, getting falling-over drunk at every convenience, and all for the most paltry of rewards.
Yes, role-playing can be hell, sometimes...

In the meantime, anyone who would like to GM a one-off session, please get in touch with a committee member soon, letting him/her know the system you will be running and number of players you can accommodate.
Anyone interested in playing, please come along and sign up for whatever system takes your fancy at the pub meeting on Thursday the 6th of February (again, see below) -prospective GMs, please get in touch before then.

Sometime this term, we shall be playing host to Oxford as they seek against overwhelming odds to regain the Broken Sword of Sharda. We have managed to win this priceless trophy for three years running now, and it would be nice to make it four. Consequently, we would like six outstanding volunteers to make up our team. Anyone interested, please get in touch with a member of the committee, soonish. The system to be used is Rolemaster. Date and venue to follow, once we've sorted out the details with Oxford. C'mon people, it's worth a quarter­ blue...

In addition to jumping out of airplanes, driving beds around Cambridge, and sleeping in igloos, you can also role-play for charity! Anyone who is interested in GMing a 24-hour-long marathon (consider getting a friend or two to help) should dust off/concoct a scenario to be played on a certain weekend around the end of term (to be announced in a forthcoming newsletter,
 



 
of course). Be sure to tell a committee member you are interested, so we can find you players (and run a tacky advert in the forthcoming newsletter). Would-be players can tl1ink about finding sponsors and laying in a stock of caffeine.

Also on a certain weekend near the end of term Uust how many of those are there, Pete?), there will be a trip to caverns south of London where you can engage in live role-playing. Talk to Harvey Maycock for details (but he won't help you with your costume). The more people that go, the less it will cost.

I.e., those of you who have left university and get your newsletters through the post. You may recall in the second newsletter that we requested the paltry sum of £2 to help cover the ever-increasing expenditure on stamps and envelopes that our keeping in touch with you requires. So far only two of you have responded (thanks, Steve, thanks, Jim). The rest of you, please note that we cannot afford to keep sending you newsletters indefinitely, so please get in touch with us if you want any more newsletters after this one. We love you guys really, but £2 isn't all that much to ask. Is it?

l"hs Eagls (Yoshiro Nishikawa)
Recently, in March 1990, The Eagle's past, in the shape of his father, the super­ assassin known as The Ninja, caught up with him. In Japan, two years previously,
before he became Ths IEaigls, Yoshiro had discovered his father's secret and revealed it to the Authorities. Needless to say, his father was not amused by this, and Yoshiro wisely fled Japan, changing his name to Joshua Chance, re-locating in New York and joining Th Gu&rdi&ns superteam.
However, all his efforts came to naught and The Ninja re-appeared. He challenged Ths  Eagle to atone for his
betrayal of the family and father and son fought in the midst of a huge thunderstorm.
The Eagle never landed a blow as the The Ninja slowly whittled him away, but he never stopped fighting. Then The Ninja struck for real, and, in a mighty blow, The Eagle was decapitated.
Though he knew he e;ouldn't win, Yoshiro fought bravely and honourably and was a credit to the good name of Th o
Gu11.rdians.
He is survived by a wife, Carol, a son, the other members of The Gu11rdi11ns, most of the rest of the planet, and his father...
