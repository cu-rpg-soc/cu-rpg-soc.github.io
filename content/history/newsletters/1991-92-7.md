lhtnual <Beneral meeting
This year's AGM will be held in the
Old JCR at Emmanuel, on Thursday, 11th June, at 7:30 PM.  Business shall consist of the election of the new Committee for next year and the following motions:

1.	Motion to amend the Society's constitution, to change the name of the Society to the Cambridge University Role-playing Society. The reason behind this is that the current name is misleading (only a few of us play D&D), and may put prospective

and £.2.50 (the difference) to upgrade from one t'other.
If anyone out there has any other motions that they would like to put to the AGM, propose them in writing, get them seconded, and give them to Pete Moore by Tuesday, 9th June.

Unless  someone  puts  forward  a
motion to abolish The Committee and run the Society as an anarcho­ syndicalist collective, a.ru1 such a motion gets passed (or indeed, past

members off joining.
2.	Motion to set the membership fee at £3.50 for one year, £6 for life

Pete, fat chance), then the election of next year's Committee will be the main  business  of  the  AGM.   The

positions to choose from are:
President	Secretary
Vice-President Asst. Secretary Junior Treasurer  External Officer If you aspire to the dizzy heights
of power, get yourself nominated and seconded in writing and get the nomination to Pete by June 9th. You can nominate yourself, or second yourself, but not both! You may stand for up to two positions on The Committee. Make it clear which is your preferred position, since you will only be deemed to be standing for your second choice if you fail to be elected to your first one. For example, you could stand for President as your first choice and Vice-president as your second, and if you fail to get elected president, you will still have the opportunity to stand for Vice-president.

This year's May Week extravaganza shall be taking place on Sunday, 14th	June, from 1 PM to 6 PM. Tickets		will	be	£5	for	Society members and £6 for non-members. This is to cover the cost of hiring the punts and the vast quantities of food that will be provided, so bring your
own drink.	Dress code - wet.	We meet  beforehand	at  the  Mill,  just

beside Scudamore's, from 11 AM onwards. That way we can set off as soon as the punts are assembled (bring some sellotape), and if anything goes wrong, we'll all be too sloshed to care. We punt upriver to Grantchester, eat, then punt back.
Tickets are available from Matt Nesbit, up until the 9th of June (in person or by post, if you send money, at King's College, CB2 1 ST).
WE NEED PUNTS! Let us know if you know anywhere we can get a cheap punt on the day, at the above time. If you can find one, book it and we'll pay for it!
f)ub meeting
The Society will prop up Gatz Bar for the last time this year from 7:30 PM onwards on Tuesday, 9th June: which	is	also	the	deadline	for nominations and motions for the AGM and the last chance to buy tickets for the Punt Party.
