How many presidents does it take to change a light-bulb? "I knew it. Something just _had_ to go wrong."

How many vice presidents does it take to change a light-bulb? "How many hit points does it have?"

How many secretaries does it take to change a light-bulb? "Change it into _what_ ?"

How many junior treasurers does it take to change a light-bulb? "I want a receipt for the old one."

How many assistant secretaries does it take to change a light-bulb? "You mean you can't see in the dark..?"

How many external officers does it take to change a light-bulb? "I dunno. Buy a copy of En Guard?"

How many committee members does it take to write a newsletter? Two actually. Here it is.

## Annual Dinner

{{cols_begin()}}

You are hereby summoned to partake of a feast most esoteric and sublime.

Featuring the Arcane Ritual of the Extra Vegetable. The venue will be the Upper Hall of Peterhouse on the evening of the 12th March.

Tickets will be the eminently reasonable price of $19, and are available from Dougal at the weekly meeting on the 19th or from the Blue Cat at any other time until the 26th. Note this is a provisionalprice - it may actually be in which case a refund will be made. A vegetairan option is also available, please let us know if you want this and your choice of mead or wine when you buy your ticket.

The dress code is Costumes or Black (Tie optional), but no real weapons will be tolerated:-

## Weekly Meetings

There is a problem with the weekly
meeting scheduled for Tuesday 26th
February. We don't have the room at
Emma. If you can't make it to the session
on the 19th and can't contact your party, we
suggest that you meet in Catz bar at 19:00
on the 26th,to sort out an alternative venue.
We should be back to normal for the week
after.

## One-Offs

Thanks to those people who turned up
and/or ran the games.

What did you think?

Was it worth while?

Do you want another?

Direct your comments at your local committee member.

## Pub Meeting

The Absolutely Nothing Whatsoever to do with the Rugby Club at the Other Table Society will muster on the evening of Thursday 21st February in Catz Bar at 19:30.

## Labyrinthe

The next trip is set for Sunday 3rd March. Contact Zebedee (email CC112) as soon as possible. There are 6 places remaining and the cost is $14.

## Varsity Match

This was to have happened on the 9th February but snow stopped play. We hope to be going on 2nd March although this is subject to confirmation from the OURPS.

The team is

|||
|--|--|
|**Chris Coward**| **Pete Moore**|
|**Matt Nesbit** |**Paul Roberts**|
|**Vo Voong** |**Iain Walker**|

with **Harvey Maycock** being our D.M.

Travel arrangements will be as before unless you are told otherwise.

## Rag Dungeon

Due to the inclement weather that reschedule the varsity match for us, the Rag Dungeon has been displaced to the second weekend of March - to whit, the 9th and 10th.

If you want to take part then you should go and see The Train to put your name down and collect a sponsorship form. If you're willing to run something, please let him know and give him some brief details.

Also if anybody is willing to let us ~~trash~~ use their room please could you give us details like size, number of chairs, tables and coffee mugs, number of irate neighbours, number of miles to the nearest toilet, presence of kette, coffeemaker, hot plate, microwave, music system etc.

## Suggestions

At last years A.G.M.,one of the points raised was that some members felt that not enough was done to help new members feel welcome and integrate into the society during the first term. If anyone feels that this is still the case please let us know and don't hesitate to make any suggestions for improvements.

## Membership Errata

Apologies to members from Fitzwilliam who were mysteriously absorbed by Emma in the membership list. We deny all knowledge of any attempted takeover bid between the two colleges. "I was there and I saw it didn't happen."

Our stalwarts at Fitzwilliam are:-

> Matthew Freestone,

> Harvey Maycock,

> Philip Hurst,

> Martin Fay.

Matt Nesbit only has one T.

Andrew Davies is no longer a member of A.H.E.C. but has now graduated to being part of the real world.

Was there anything else we got wrong?
