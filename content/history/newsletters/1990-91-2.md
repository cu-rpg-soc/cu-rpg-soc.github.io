|**GM:**| (drawing a map) _OK, this is the house. Remember that all you have to do is collect the package that the mysterious NPC in black told you about. What do you do?_|
|**Random Qabbal PC:**| _I think we should burst in and shoot everyone with my cranequin._|
|**Space Marine:**| _I say we take off and nuke the site from orbit. It's the only way to be sure._|
|**Dragonquest Courtesan:**| _I'm going to seduce this small garden ornament._|
|**Warhammer Trollslayer:**| _Grrrrrrr, gerroff._|
|**AD&D Thief:**| _I'm going to check this poisoned spring mechanism for traps._|
|**GM:**| _Yes Yes but seriously, what are you going to do?_|
|**Random Qabbal PC:**| _I'm going to burst in and shoot everyone with my cranequin._|
|**Space Marine:**| _I say we take off and nuke the site_ etc. etc.|

At this point, to the GM's great relief, Emmanuel's Upper Hall slid off the edge of the world.

## Wasteland

tick...tick...tick...tick...
Time is running out for the society magazine. We still do not have enough material to
make up another issue. Articles and artwork will be gratefully received by any committee
member. The deadline is Wednesday 20th November. After this date we either have
enough material for a magazine, or Wasteland dies. This time for good,with no saving
throw and (at this rate) no chance of resurrection. Come on guys, you don't want this on
your consciences...

## Reading

Our Role Playing counterparts at Reading University have invited us down on the
weekend of 17th/18th November for a random combination of Role Playing and Drinking.
Anybody who wants to come should get in touch with one of the committee. Limited
transport is available on a first come,first served basis. If demand for transport exceeds
that available and anybody wants to make their own way to Reading, then arrangements
will be made to rendezvous there before things get underway.

## Pub Meeting

The next communal ritual of libation shall be conducted on the unhallowed grounds of
Catz Bar. The date shall be Wednesday 7th November, at 7:30pm.

## Games & Puzzles Discount

Members please note that the discount offered by Games & Puzzles is subject to certain
conditions. Namely:-
i) The discount is not available on Saturdays.
ii) The discount is available only for student members of the society.
iii) The discount is available only on production of a current membership card with the expiry date clearly written on it. If you do not have an expirydate written on your card then please write it in. Since this applies mainly to life members, this date will be that on which you expect to leave University, but only up to a maximum of three years from now.

## Photos

Re the photographs from last year's dinner - we have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that we have some photos and they were rather cheaper than we expected. This means that we can refund approximately 40% of the original price. Now for the bad news. They are the wrong photos. That is to say, they are photos from last year's dinner but not the ones we specifically ordered. Unfortunately the photographers got things mixed up and have now ceased trading, so we can't get them replaced.
The photos we do have (and the refund) can be collectedfrom Dave Prince. We have the right number of them, and they're the right size, so it won't have been a complete disaster.....

## Chistmas Party

This will be held on Saturday 8th December. Details to followso keep that evening free.

## Labyrinthe

Following hot on the heels of the Christmas party will be this term's trip to Labyrinthe.
If you want to hit people with rubber swords or shout arcane Words of Power at
eccentrically attired monsters, then see Chris Carr. We will be going for a double length
dungeon on the morning and afternoon of Sunday 9th Dismember (Oops. Slip of the
keyboard). It's currently believed to cost $14 but it may have gone up. Chris should have
the precise details.
First timers note that we have a copy of the Labyrinthe rulebook and supplement in the
Library
