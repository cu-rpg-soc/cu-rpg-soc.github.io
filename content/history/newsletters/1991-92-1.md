1 - Character Generation

"(A) Charactcr is the rcsull of a system or stereotyped principles." David "Try rolling your Constilulion aga.in," Hume

2 - Combat

TuE PLAYER: It's what [characters] do best. They have to exploit whalcvcr talent is given to them, and their talent is dying. They can die heroically, comically, ironically, slowly, suddenly, disgustingly, charmingly, or from a great height...

ROSENCRANTZ.: Is that all they can do - die?

TuE PLAYER: No, no - they kill beautifully. In fact somi: or them kill even better than they die. The rest die better than they kill. 11,ey're a team.

Froa "Rosencrantz and Guiidcm1cm an: Deod""by Toa "This is probably a good lime lo spend a Fate Point" Stoppard

3 - Character Advancement

"lnat which does not kill us makes us stronger." Friedrich "Oh all ri&lit,have another 200 Experience Poims" Nietzschc

The Society organises weekly role-playing sessions. during which a number of different campaigns will be run. Members will also have the opportunity lo try out new or different game systems, not only in these regular campaigns, but also in occasional meetings devoted to one­ off scenarios, held roughly once a term. Members of the commillee are usually lo be found at these meetings, just in case you have difficulty in contacting them at other times. These meetings usually adjourn to the nearest bar afterwards.

Provisional arrangements have been made to hold the weekly meetings in the Upper Hall at Emmanuel on Tuesdays during Full Term, from 7:00pm to 10:30pm. The first meeting will be on Tuesday 15th October. Prospective GMs wishing to arrange campaigns should arrive early.

Other Regular Events

VIDEO EVENINGS - We will be holding a number of video showings throughout the year. Requests and suggestions welcome.

LABYRINIB - Live Role-Playing trips are arranged to Labyrinth (deep in the howel,sof

Chislehurst Caves) roughly once a term.

Annual Events

CHRISlMAS PARTY - Mulled wine, mince pies and al least one bar room brawl.

ANNUAL DINNER - Usually held around March. Fancy Dress, Black Tie optional.

Last Year's A.G.M.

A late news item... Since last year's A.G.M. was held right at the end of term, we were unable to get a Newsletter out informing you of wh t mn.rnPnfn11s ,-1,,,-;.,;n!!" ,uoro .,,.,,1,._

Firstly, the new system for electing committee members that had been proposed failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority required to write it into the constitution. Those present did however give the President a mandate to write the old system into the constitution, so that last year's confusion will hopefully not be visited on the Society again.

Secondly, a motion to change the name of the Society to the Cambridge University Role­ Playing Society (C.U.R.P.S.) also failed to get a two-thirds majority, and was also rejected.

Thirdly, this year's committee was elected. For who they are, what they are to be known as, and where they may be found, see below.
