<p>Hello and welcome to the Cambridge UNiversity Role-Playing Society (you are going to join, aren’t you?) We exist to promote Role-Playing in all its multifarious forms, whether AD&amp;D, Cyberpunk, Cthulhu, Champions, Warhammar, GURPS, Traveller or Qabbal… You name it, we play it, and even if we don’t, we can probably help you organise it if you want to run it (and need players) or play it (and need a GM). It doesn’t matter if you’ve been playing for years, or if you’re only just thinking of taking up role-playing here and now, either way you won’t be the only one, and there is usually a game going on somewhere to suit any taste. Since your interest has sustained you this far into the Newsletter, you are cordially invited to</p>
