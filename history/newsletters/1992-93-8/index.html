<p>At the AGM the following people were elected to serve as next year’s Committee:-</p>
<p>President - Chris Watts (Christ’s)</p>
<p>Vice-Pres. - Duncan Forsyth (Trinity Hall}</p>
<p>Secretary - Mark Brown (Peterhouse}</p>
<p>Junior Treasurer - Tom Williams (Girton}</p>
<p>Asst. Secretary - Ian Lewis (Emmanuel)</p>
<p>External Officer - Ed Carter (Surreal World)</p>
<p>Since these public-spirited folk were the <em>only</em> ones who stood, the rest of you have only got yourselves to blame…</p>
<p>We also amended the Constitution to the effect that in the event of the dissolution of the Society (not that that’s ever going to happen) we spend all our residual money on games and then place everything in storage in the U.L to await the future refounding of the Society.</p>
<p>And a resolution was passed obliging the Committee to do all in their power to encourage people at the Weekly Meetings to come along to the pub afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="chapter-1">Chapter 1</h2>
<ol>
<li>In the beginning were the rules, and the rules were with God, and the rules were God.</li>
<li>And God said “Let them be bought”, and they were bought.</li>
<li>And God saw that it was good.</li>
<li>Evening passed and morning came, and that was the first day.</li>
<li>And God said</li>
<li>Behold I draw a line and do separate the sea from the land.</li>
<li>And God saw that it was good.</li>
<li>Evening passed and morning came, and that was the second day.</li>
<li>And God did raise up mountains and set down rivers,</li>
<li>And forests did grow up where he set his foot,</li>
<li>And weather systems did cohere in close proximity to their opposite.</li>
<li>And God saw that it was good.</li>
<li>Evening passed and morning came, and that was the third day.</li>
<li>And God did create many strange creatures, and did send them forth into the land,</li>
<li>And did say unto them</li>
<li>Go forth and multiply, but have no regard for what you will ea,t, for behold,</li>
<li>I have created you all carnivores.</li>
<li>And God saw that it was good.</li>
<li>Evening passed and morning came, and that was the fourth day.</li>
<li>And God did form in his mind many strange civilisations,</li>
<li>And they did come to populate the globe in very vastness,</li>
<li>And behold they did fall for no apparent reason, leaving behind their ruins,</li>
<li>And behold they did somehow manage to leave all their treasure in these ruins,</li>
<li>And verily the people who lived there did not touch it,</li>
<li>For it was dedicated to God.</li>
<li>And God saw that it was good.</li>
<li>Evening passed and morning came, and that was the fifth day.</li>
<li>And God was lonely in his world, so God did create NPCs, making them in his own image.</li>
<li>And these NPCs were formed from the best cardboard,</li>
<li>And lo the best of them were truly two dimensional,</li>
<li>And God did set them down in the village of Eden,</li>
<li>Where there was a shop that sold plate mail in vast quantities,</li>
<li>And a population that spent all its time in the tavern,</li>
<li>And verily did not talk unto strangers but merely looked upon them with a dark gaze.</li>
<li>And God saw that it was good.</li>
<li>Evening passed and morning came, and that was the sixth day.</li>
<li>And on the seventh day, God roleplayed.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="chapter-2">Chapter 2</h2>
<ol>
<li>And lo God spake unto his players, saying,</li>
<li>Behold my new campaign world,</li>
<li>And verily, I have been working on it all week.</li>
<li>And the players waxed sore impressed, and did take the rules and generate their characters.</li>
<li>But one of the players did find a loophole in the rules, and did create a super-character,</li>
<li>And he did name him Lucifer, which signifieth, Light-bringer,</li>
<li>B t Go_d ?id misgive him in his heart. and did pnvily nameth the character Satan, which is, The Adversary.</li>
<li>An_d behold the characters did meet the mam NPC,</li>
<li>And verily he did tell Lucifer that he looked a fool in all that rumour</li>
<li>And Lucifer waxed wroth with the man,</li>
<li>And did strike him with his Magic Sword,</li>
<li>And behold the NPC was stricken unto death.</li>
<li>And God did wax passing wroth with Lucifer, and did say</li>
<li>Cursed art thou, Lucifer, among all the players. For what thou hast done thou shalt go upon thy belly in the dust</li>
<li>And Lucifer spake uno God, saying</li>
<li>Thou bastard, just because thy character failed his saving throw.</li>
<li>Thou canst not do this unto me.</li>
<li>And God saw that Lucifer waxed prideful and did cast him into the outer darkness,</li>
<li>And there was much wailing and gnashing of teeth.</li>
<li>And the other players did murmur among themselves, saying</li>
<li>Who will now buy the drinks, for Lucifer had a proper job.</li>
<li>And they did look unto the LORD for succour,</li>
<li>But the LORD was a student and had a massive overdraft.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="chapter-3">Chapter 3</h2>
<ol>
<li>And behold the campaign did continue,</li>
<li>And Lucifer did foment	. rebellion against the LORD fromoutside,</li>
<li>Anddid promise to run Vampire if they would but tum fromthe LORD and worship him.</li>
<li>And the players were sore tempted.</li>
<li>And the LORD heard the murmurings from the players,</li>
<li>Like unto a very lynchmob,</li>
<li>And did wax woth with them, saying in his heart,</li>
<li>They doth forget all the work I put into this world.</li>
<li>And the LORD did resolve to punish the players.</li>
<li>And behold there was a great flood and the world was drowned,</li>
<li>But the LORD’s favourite NPC did build an ark and survive the flood,</li>
<li>And the players did rail truly against the LORD, saying</li>
<li>We have spent much time on those characters, thou canst not just kill them.</li>
<li>And why did thy NPC build a bloody great ship in the middle of the desert just before the flood, thou cheat?</li>
<li>And the LORD did say unto them</li>
<li>I am the LORD, and I can do as I will.</li>
<li>And the players did all turn from the LORD and willfully leave him.</li>
<li>And the LORD did wail and gnash his teeth,	.	,</li>
<li>But the players joined Lucifer s Vampire Chronicle,	.</li>
<li>And verily they saw that 1t was good.</li>
