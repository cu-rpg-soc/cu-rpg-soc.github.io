<p>1st Player: ’Ibis irksome plot of which I now must speak Rath latterly congealed a rancid knot - Brave Alexander ay would stay his blade
From such dire twists as now do make us weep.
3rd Player: No plot hath I discerned these sessions past; No orcish blood hath soiled mine girdled steel. What manner strange of game do we now play, Where mindless violence hath no princely part?
1st Player: Of this campaign I gibber not - instead From labyrinthine Amber hales my tale What happened last I must reveal anon…
4th Player: Methinks you hath already told us twice. 2nd Player: Good players all, do now behold this sheet
On which mine back-up character is made:</p>

<p>A Trip to Oxfort,. ittcorporatitt5
Th Varstt11 Match</p>
<p>JUST 11IE VARSITY MA TCTT TEAM. Try and think
of it as a mini-RPG convention. Or something.
The Plan is to go down to Oxford on the evening of Friday 26th Fchruary, spend Saturday playing various silly games (including some LRP), and then to play tbe Varsity Match on the Sunday afternoon, coming back to Cambridge that evening. Transport costs will be spread evenly between everyone who comes along, but will al&lt;;o be subsidised by the Society.
If enough of you want to come along, we’U try
and hire a mi.nj-bus, otherwise we will try and get cnougb cars together to take everybody, although as a last resort, some of us may have to use public transport. So if anyone out there is interested, and has a car, we want to hear from you - you could save us all a lot of money. And if any of you are interested, but can’t make the entire weekend, there will be a car going down to Oxford on the Sunday morning, for the Varsity Match itself.</p>
<p>Lab:\irittthe
Just a reminder that our next LRP expcrution is on Sunday 7th March. David Wright would like to know definite numbers for the trip by Tuesday 23rd February, so get in touch with him by then.</p>
<p>or at least 6 of you. This is the last call for volunteers before we send round the press-gang, so come and see us NOW. Note that we need a GM as well as players. Our colleagues in OURPS have planned an entire weekend of entertainments for us, AND TllE l.NVT1’ATION EXTENDS TO ALL MEMBERS OF 11-IE SOCIE1Y, NOT</p>
