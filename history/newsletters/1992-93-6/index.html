<p><em>Ye Tragicall Comedie Of Advanced CyberCthulhu &amp; Gurpshammer 2000</em></p>
<p><em>- Act II, Scene III -</em></p>
<p>GM:</p>
<p>(Alatums)
A pox bcstill thy rabbled tongues, I say! Thou should have known of Pub Meets long Decried of old. What fault be it of mine
If fain thou readest not thy Newsletters?</p>
<p>Thy loved ones must you sacrifice, and thence To Hell condemn their weeping, blameless souls.
3rdP1ayer: What loved ones these? You cannot tTap us thus: No backgrounds for our Characters were writ.
1st Player:  I wrote one.</p>
<p>4th Player: Certes, those mystic parchments would I scry
If ere I could. Alas, I cannot read, For it is thusly writ so here upon My Character Sheet.</p>
<p>3rd Player:	You pillock! Behold thy prize,
/\s vasty boles loom forth inside our heads!
(Exit the Players g,umhling)</p>
<p>GM:	Lord, I crave thy strength.
But of our game: an NPC bath come With visage grim to tell to you the Plot.
NPC:		Whereof I speak is naught but lurking doom, That ere doth skibble forth across the land. For you a mighty task doth lie ahead:
Naught else may stem this horrid tide of woe.
2nd Player: Jasmina doth mislike the sound of this.
What task?
NPC:		This deed alone will ere suffice: With sharpened spade of black and potent rune And ay with bloody mess and cries of shame,</p>
<p>GM:</p>
<p>Hobbit:</p>
<p>GM:</p>
<p>Of sessions five and sixty did it take,
But now at last the Plot proceeds \vithaJ.
(Enter a hobbit pursued by a bear)
Behold this sharpened spade that I bath “found”: From party’s back it fell with silent donk.
Stop thief! Alone that Plot Device might save Mine game-world forged of long and laboured hours.
Wouldst thou provoke mine hopping wrath of rage?
Unhand it now, thou mercenary git!
(Exit a hobbit purwed by a GM)</p>
<p>The One-Off sessions to be held on Tuesday 9th March will take place in Clare Buttery from 7:45pm - 10:45pm. GMs take note that we’ve only got 3 hours instead of the usual 31/2. Don’t forget to come along to the Pub Meeting on Tuesday 2nd March to sign up for things.</p>

This year’s AGM will be held in Z Basement, Christ’s, on Tuesday-9th Mardi at 7pm. The main business will be the election of next year’s Committee. The posts up for election are:-</p>
<p>Weekly Meetings will continue for the first and third weeks of next term:-</p>
<p>President
Vice-President</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary Junior Treasurer</p>
<p>Tuesday 20th April, 7pm -
Tuesday 4th May, 7pm -</p>
<p>Old JCR. Emma Upper Hall, Emma</p>
<p>Secretary</p>
<p>External Officer</p>
<p>Any member of the Society is eligible to stand for any of these posts, although it would help if you are also intending to be here in Cambridge next year…	Most of the current ommittee do not intend to stand for re­ clcction. so if you want a Society at all next year -
TANl&gt;!!!
Should you aspire to the dizzy heights of power, get yourself nominated and seconded (in writing please), and get that nomination to Chris Carr by midnight on Sunday 25th April. Your nominator and seconder must both be (different) members of the Society - you can nominate yourself. or second yourself. but not both. You may stand for up to two positions on the Committee - a preferred position. and a fall­ back position for whjch you may still stand should you fail to be elected to your preferred post. For example, you could stand for President as your first choice and Vice-President as your second, and if you failed to be elected President, you would still have the opportunity to stand for Vice-President.
However, bear in mind that the various posts will be voted on in order (ie., President, then Vice-President., then Secretary and so on), so there is little point in standing for one of the later positions as your first choice and one of the earlier ones as your second, since by the time we get to the post of your first choice, the post of your second choice will already have been filled.
Clear enough? Jolly good.
Nominations are open Now. Think about whether or not you want to stand over Easter by all means, but don’t forget that the deadline for nominations is at the end of tl1e first week of next term.</p>
<p>Most of the rest of the AGM will be taken up with the Reading of the Minutes of Last Year’s A.GM, the Jwuor Treac;urer’s Report, a lot of interminable	self-congratulation,	and	any motions that anyone would like to put forward for discussion by the Society. Such motions must be proposed and seconded in writing, and passed n to Chris Carr.	Again, the deadline is
midnight, Sunday 25th April.</p>

<p>Absolute deadline for buying tickets to the Annual Diriucr is Wednesday 3rd March.</p>

<p>By popular request, the following new additions have been made to the Society Library, and are now available for borrovving:-
Shadowrun (2nd Ed.)	Warhammer Companion Gurps Imperial Rome	Ninja Hero (Champions) Vampire Players Guide	 Amber</p>
<h2 id="rag-dl-ftt5cott">Rag Dl-ftt5cott</h2>
<p>\Veil. despite tbe underwhelming response, we did actually manage to raise some money for Rag. Thanks to the GMs (and commiserations to those GMs who went to the trouble of preparing something but got bugger-all support), and to the hardy handful of players who risked their bio-rhythms for the Greater Good.</p>
