<h3 id="translator-s-note-an-introduction-to-illegible-gothic-typefaces">TRANSLATOR’S NOTE - An Introduction to Illegible Gothic Typefaces</h3>
<p>Apparently some people had difficulty deciphering our last Newsletter, so in the interests of clarity, all headings have been sub-titled, and the following guide to the perplexed has been included. The essence of your average Gothic Typeface is that most of the letters look like other letters. However, with a little practice, one becomes used to this and can learn to read Gothic text fluently. To assist you in this, We have included a number of common GMs’ utterances, written in Gothic, accompanied by their translations into a more legible typeface.</p>
<div class="gothic">
<ol>
<li>“Take four points of damage” - <span class="std">“Got you, you bastard.”</span></li>
<li>“I’ll make the roll for you” -  <span class="std">“You’re about to discover the plot, and I can’t stop you except by cheating.”</li>
<li>“You mean you’ve run out of Fate Points?” -  <span class="std">see #1</span></li>
<li>“Just don’t roll 96-100” -  <span class="std">“I have cursed your dice.”</span></li>
<li>“You’ll need a critical success’ -  <span class="std">“I wish I’d cursed your dice.”</span></li>
<li>“Can I see your Character Sheet, please?” -  <span class="std">“Doesn’t your Character have <em>any</em> weak points”</span></li>
<li>“Your  opponent is still standing” -  <span class="std">“I am mentally reconfiguring his Hit Points.”</span></li>
<li>“I Think we’ll leave it there for this week” -  <span class="std">“Maybe I didn’t kill you all, but at least I’ve got you seriously worried.”</span></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="trans-let-s-play-something-else">(trans. - Let’s play something else)</h3>
<p>The weekly meeting on Tuesday 26th November will be devoted entirely to One Off scenarios.· This is to allow people to try new systems. for people playing in other campaigns to GM something of their own, or·for GMs to tale a break and play something for a change. H you want to run something. please tell a member of the committee by oc at the next Pub Meeting (see later). giving details of the system you want to run, and the number of players wanted.	Prospective players should come to the weekly meeting on Tuesday 1st  November. and sign up for the scenario of their choice, so that the GMs will know just how many people they will have to cater for. Regular campaigns	will then resume on Tuesday 3rd December.</p>
<h2 id="christmas-party">Christmas Party</h2>
<h3 id="trans-it-s-mulled-wine-and-mince-pie-time">(trans. - It’s mulled wine and mince pie time)</h3>
<p><strong>WHEN?</strong> Saturday 7th December. 7:00pm.</p>
<p><strong>WHERE?</strong> Ramsden Room. Catz.</p>
<p><strong>WHY?</strong> Because we’11 be serving mince pies and mulled wine, and there’11 be numerous silly games to play (or avoid).</p>
<p><strong>HOW MUCH?</strong> A mere £3. Tickets will be available from · Matt Nesbit at any society meeting.</p>
<p>We will not be holding a separate Christmas Dungeon this year - instead. we are hoping to have a few· more games running at the Christmas Party itsel•f . H anyone would like to run something. get.in touch with a committee member sometime soon. Last year we had a Twilight 2000 firefight in a fuel dump, and a Qabbal drug den brawl, just to give you some idea.</p>

<p>This Campaign is set in southern Middle Earth 200 to 300 years before the Lord of the Rings.. It will begin with a series of short adventures and will be tailored to the party’s desires later on. Not just hack and slash, some good sense is required. [Players sought] Tuesday

<p>I am running a nearly systemless political campaign. The fantasy setting is one of an arctic tundra, populated by antagonistic and proud tribes of nomadic hunter-gatherers. The characters are tribesmen and women, who ave been shocked out of the political ignorance by a chance encounter. From this point on, their options are open: to right injustices, or to use their new-found subjectiv ty to further their own desire for power, magic, peace of mind or just to be anarchic. The aim of the ga,me is to be as selfish, manipulative and machiavellian as possible, or to have feelings of genuine outrage and a desire to do good. <u>The game penalizes heavily all unplanned violence. and any open combat  is likely to reduce the players to bird food</u>. Though assassination, back stabbing, poisoning, thievery, etc. are strongly suggested, the opposition are intelligent. [1 player sought]	<span style="float:right;">Monday</span></p>

<p>A game set in the Enlightenment, at thje start of the industrial Revolution. Not <u>our</u> Industrial Revolution, of course. This is a world where magick is harnessed as a technological tool, where Daemons and Difference Engines co-exist, enchanted dirigibles wage war with 100-gun ships of the line, where the new and growing class of venture capitalists buy and sell shares in the vilest of occult horrors… The ideal place for a disparate group of PCs chareged with the task of discovering the plot. So far, they know that they;re trying to track down a wizard’s library, which if found, will enable their country to win a (so far) long and costly war.

<p>Quentin Carroll: 314805	 <span style="float:right;">Twilight 2000</span></p>
<p>Over 50 years of European peace ended on 27 July 1996 with the outbreak of WWIII. A year later, the nukes started flying. By 2000 AD, civilization has vanished into nuclear fire, and the resulting famines, plagues and radiation have accounted for 50% of the wor1d’s population. Yet the war drags on. Warlords, militias and marauders rule a devastated countryside; civilian government rarely exists outside people’s memories of a happier time. This is a game of survival in a post-Holocaust world where equipment is scarce and alcohol powers the few remaining vehicles. The hazards are many and the reward may simply be a safe place t  sleep.
