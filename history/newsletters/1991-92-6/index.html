<p>The  Viking single handedly took down Pete’s entire Champions party last Tuesday.	As if he wasn’t popular enough with them already…</p>
<h2 id="more-campaign-reports">More Campaign Reports</h2>
<p>These campaigns are full up, but</p>
<p>loomed out of the mists of Ragnarok we	just	wanted	to	warn	you	what to loot and destroy, bands of men of sick minds are up to out there: Denmark would take to the high seas</p>
<p>Baleful Tidings - Alex Jones, GURPS</p>
<p>This campaign has been described as  “somewhat unusual.”  This is  probably something of  an  to understatement.   The  party:  an    “Indiana Jones” from a Shadowrun a  maths  professor  who   Vikings  to  prove  their  bravery,  to has recently discovered rune-magic; a - - ,lease the Old Gods, to reach their trigger-happy   private   eye  with   strong views on local government, and a blacksmith from the Highlands… They’re trying to save Earth from the paranoid, megelomaniac, blood-drinking Bales. Unfortunately, they’re on Yrth, with no idea where to find their enemy, although they’re closer than they were when fighting Terradyne security or learning how to fly on Flight 13…
<br/><br/>
Vikings-Helen Steele, Runequest</p>
<p>In the Dark Ages, before Christianity had spread to the north of Europe, when the Viking longships loomed out of the mists of Ragnarok to look and destroy, bands of men of Denmark would take to the high sees and the rivers in search not only of fortune but honor. Controlled by fate, they venture out, to kill or be killed, to trade, to discover new lands,
fight honourably and die a Viking –  sword in hand.  Is it fated for our type  world; to reach their goals, to make it home?</p>
<h2 id="wanted-news-from-the-unreal-world">Wanted: News from the unreal world</h2>
<p>In the last newsletter, we’d like to
print more campaign reports, of what you and your silly players did this year.  Please send these to Becky Teed at Emma or to RT108 on Phoenix. Fnord.
