	NEWSLETTER the Third 1990&#x2F;91 - Sci-fi
</h1>
<p>Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away, our heroes had got themselves involved in many large and complicated subplots. Having blown these away (who said the pen is mightier than the antimatter missile?) the main plot reared its ugly and radioactive head.</p>
<p>“Right you are facing the evil liche ‘Wasteland”’ said the G.M.</p>
<p>“OK guys, where’s the NBC suits? And pass me the owners manual for the Z-Meson Gun.“ordered the fearless paladin, having just realised that by some quirk of die rolling that his +5 Holy Avenger didn’t work in a vacuum.</p>
<p>“I want to kill it!” said the marine leaning out of the air lock with his gauss rifle.</p>
<p>“No, me! It’s my turn!” shouted the psychotic Jedi.</p>
<p>“You killed it last time. I want a go.” complained the giant slayer.</p>
<p>The party continued squabbling, the G.M. sighed, and the plot died of boredom.</p>
<div class="cols"><h2 id="christmas-party">Christmas Party</h2>
<p>This is it, the event that you’ve been waiting
for all term, and guess what….. especially for
you we’ve made it into two events to be held on
Saturday 8th December; the Christmas
Dungeon and the Christmas Party.
The dungeon will be a regular session for
irregular games, held in the afternoon
between 12:00 and 17:00. in the Party Room,
Downing. Anyone who wants to run
something at this please let us know in
advance.
The party will be held after the dungeon at
19:00 - 23:00 in the Ramsden Room, Catz.. This
will require a ticket, purchased in advance be-
cause Pete Moore will be on the door (well the
remains of it). The price is C3 and this will get
you minced pies, mulled wine and the choice
between a Twilight 2000 firefight and a Qabbal
drug den brawl. Tickets are available from
Ginni or Dave Prince at or before the next Pub
Meeting.</p>
<h2 id="dub-meeting">Dub meeting</h2>
<p>In our alternative guise as the League of
Unfettered Inebriation we shall be meeting on
Wednesday 5th December at 19:30 in Catz Bar.</p>
<h2 id="labyrinthe">Labyrinthe</h2>
<p>Your hardworking external officer has re-
ceived a very pleasant and encouragingreply
from these nice rubber-sworded people. The
cost of a double length adventure on Sunday 9th
Dec is still only $14. The two catches are that
there must be a minimum of ten of us and the
money has to be in a week early, so the money
must be in to Chris Carr by Friday 30th
November. Pete Garner (the organiser) says
that he’s paying a G.M. to write a double
adventure specially for us for that day, so it
sounds good. Any queries email CC112 or drop
in and see Chris personally.</p>
<p>There is a problem with the weekly meeting
scheduled for Tuesday 4th December. We don’t
have the room at Emma. Due to excessive
rooms charges elsewhere, we can’t get
anywhere else. We suggest that G.M.s and
players arrange to play elsewhere. Those who
can’t contact their party in time should meet
in Catz bar at 19:00to sort this out. We should
be back to normal for next term.</p>
<h2 id="one-offs">One-Offs</h2>
<p>Following issues raised at the A.G.M.last
year regarding the nature of our gaming ses-
sions, we want to arrange an evening of one-off
scenarios. The idea is to give members an op-
portunity to experience something different,
rather than tie themselves down to the same
old campaigns, week in, week out. We also
hope that this will encourage some of our less
active members to come along to the weekly
sessions.
In an unheard of move, we, the committee,
have decided to try and organise something
along these lines, for the third weekly session
of next term. We hope that current G.M.s will
be willing to suspend their campaigns for one
week and run something different either in
their own system, or if they prefer, in another.
Anyone else who wants to run something is
very welcome to do so and the more people who
come along to try things out, the better.
We would like to advertise this beforehand
in the first or second Newsletter of next, so
please could prospective G.M.s send details
(i.e. system, preferable number of players,
anticipated style of play, etc.) to Dave Prince &lt;DKP10&gt;
or Iain Walker.</p>
<h2 id="varsity-match">Varsity-match</h2>
<p>This year’s earth shattering slugfest be-
tween the powers of Light and Dark (guess
which one we are) has been arranged for the
weekend of the 9th and 10th of February. It is be-
ing hosted by Oxfordthis year and they have
chosen the AD&amp;D system (surprise surprise). If
you are interested in representing the powers of
D-oops… er, that is our wonderful society then
give your name to Chris Carr. We will be
holding selection dungeons at the first and
second sessions of next term to choose the lucky
(?) team. Any member of the society is eligible
except those who have represented us before.
More of this in the next Newsletter.</p>
<h2 id="games-puzzles-discount">Games &amp; Puzzles Discount</h2>
<p>Members please note (again) that the discount
offered by Games &amp; Puzzles is subject to certain
conditions. Firstly, the discount is not available
on Saturdays. Secondly, the discount is
available only for student members of the
society and is not transferable. Thirdly and
most importantly,from the start of next term
the discount will only be available on production
of a current membership card with the
date clearly written on it. If you do not have an
expiry date written on your card then please
write it in. Since this applies mainly to life
members,this date will be that on uhich you
expect to leave University,but only up to a
maximum of three years from now.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>Many Thanks to those who came along (Matt
and Doug) and helped us wipe the floor with
them. We won the AD&amp;D dungeon crawling
tournament, the game of Kingmaker and the
(in)consequential 1920’s gangster card game.
Also many orders of magnitude more thanks to
the Pres for driving us there and the J T for let.
ting us use her car.</p>
<h2 id="video-evenings">Video Evenings</h2>
<p>We would like to arrange a video evening or
two for next term, but we have yet to find a suit-
able room. Is there anybody out there who
knows of a room, equipped with TV and VCR,
that wouldbe available to us? If so please let us
know. Also, requests for actual films would be
welcome, otherwise Iain is liable to choose
them all…</p>
<h2 id="library">Library</h2>
<p>Suggestions are now being taken for what
we should spend our money on (note suggestions should be sent to Quinton so don’t try
anything silly). Please could you also include
reasons for your suggestions, “I want to try out
CyberPunk and you haven’t got it” is fine, that’s
what we’re here for, but “I’ve got CyberPunk
and I think it’s so fantastic that other members
should know about it” is more informative. We
will also consider things like source books on
medieval weaponry and castles. Will everyone
who has anything on loan please see Quinton
before the end of term.</p>
